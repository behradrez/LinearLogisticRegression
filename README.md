This repository contains a Machine Learning project developing a model that predicts Parkinson's disease progression, as well as breast cancer detection, through the design, training, and validation of Linear and Logistic Regression models, developed from scratch. Various experiments were performed to evaluate and optimize the models' performances.

`Models.py` contains the implementations from scratch of Linear and Logistic Regression models, as well as a customizable Gradient Descent class. All 3 classes include customization hyperparameters that can be experimented with.

`Report.ipynb` contains the performed experiments and their results.

To run the project, 
1.  Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv .venv` and activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`

2. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Explore the `Report.ipynb` report and `Models.py` classes and make changes as needed
